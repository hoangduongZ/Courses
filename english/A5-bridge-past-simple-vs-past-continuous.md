# A5 – Bridge 1: Past Simple vs Past Continuous

## Purpose

A5 giúp bạn **kể chuyện quá khứ đúng “timeline”**: phân biệt **bối cảnh (background)** và **sự kiện chính (main event)** để tránh viết “tất cả đều Past Simple” hoặc “tất cả đều Past Continuous”.

---

## Key points

- **Past Simple** = hành động **xảy ra & kết thúc** (main event, chuỗi sự kiện).
- **Past Continuous** = hành động **đang diễn ra** tại một thời điểm trong quá khứ (background, đang… thì…).
- **Template quan trọng nhất:**
  - **Background (Past Continuous)** + **when** + **Main event (Past Simple)**
  - *I was walking home when it started to rain.*
- **while** thường dùng để mô tả **2 hành động đang diễn ra song song**:
  - Past Continuous + while + Past Continuous
- **BẪY 1:** dùng Past Continuous cho “main event” (sự kiện ngắn) → sai nghĩa.
- **BẪY 2:** dùng Past Simple cho cả 2 vế khi một vế là bối cảnh kéo dài.
- **BẪY 3:** nghĩ “when luôn Past Simple” → không đúng. (When + Past Continuous vẫn có thể đúng nếu đó là bối cảnh dài.)

## Rule summary

| Use-case | Form | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Background + main event (gián đoạn)** | Past Continuous + **when** + Past Simple | I **was taking** a shower when the phone **rang**. |
| **2 hành động song song** | Past Continuous + **while** + Past Continuous | She **was studying** while I **was cooking**. |
| **Chuỗi sự kiện ngắn (không nhấn bối cảnh)** | Past Simple + when + Past Simple | I **arrived** when he **left**. |
| **Nhấn thời điểm cụ thể trong quá khứ** | Past Continuous + time marker | At 9 PM, we **were watching** a movie. |

**Gợi ý chọn thì nhanh (2 bước):**
1) Trong 2 vế, vế nào là **bối cảnh dài/đang diễn ra** → Past Continuous.
2) Vế nào là **sự kiện chính/điểm xảy ra** → Past Simple.

## Examples

### 1) Background + main event (đang… thì…)
1. I **was working** when my manager **called** me.
2. We **were having** dinner when the lights **went** out.
3. She **was driving** home when she **saw** an accident.

### 2) Two actions in progress (song song)
4. While I **was doing** my homework, my brother **was playing** games.
5. They **were talking** quietly while the baby **was sleeping**.

### 3) When không nhất thiết luôn Past Simple
6. When I **was walking** to the bus stop, I **met** my old teacher. (walking = background dài)

### 4) Past Simple chain (chuỗi sự kiện ngắn)
7. I **opened** the door, **walked** in, and **sat** down.

### 5) Mixed mini-story (đúng “story flow”)
8. It **was raining**, and I **was looking** for a taxi when my friend **texted** me.

## Common mistakes

| ❌ SAI | ✅ ĐÚNG | Giải thích |
|---|---|---|
| I was meeting him yesterday. | I met him yesterday. | “yesterday” thường là sự kiện hoàn tất (Past Simple). |
| I watched TV when the phone was ringing. | I was watching TV when the phone rang. | TV = background; phone rang = event ngắn. |
| While I cooked, she was studying. | While I was cooking, she was studying. | “while” thường kéo background → ưu tiên Continuous. |
| When I arrived, he was left. | When I arrived, he left. / he was leaving. | “was left” sai nghĩa bị động; chọn Simple hoặc Continuous tùy ý nghĩa. |
| I was reading when the phone was ringing. | I was reading when the phone rang. | “when” thường đi với main event (Past Simple). |
| They didn’t were playing. | They weren’t playing. | Phủ định Past Continuous: wasn’t/weren’t + V-ing. |

## Self-check rubric

✅ Tôi đã đạt task A5 nếu:

- [ ] Tôi xác định đúng **background** vs **main event** trong câu
- [ ] Tôi dùng đúng pattern: **was/were + V-ing** (background)
- [ ] Tôi dùng đúng **Past Simple** cho sự kiện ngắn/hoàn tất
- [ ] Tôi dùng **while** hợp lý cho hành động song song
- [ ] Tôi làm đúng ≥ 13/15 Practice A

## Notes

- “when” không phải lúc nào cũng Past Simple; quan trọng là **ý nghĩa dài/ngắn**.
- Nếu cả hai hành động đều dài và song song → ưu tiên **Past Continuous + while + Past Continuous**.
