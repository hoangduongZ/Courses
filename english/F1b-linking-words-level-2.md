# F1b – Linking words Level 2 (however / therefore / despite / in spite of)

> Mục tiêu task: viết “formal” hơn (đặc biệt khi viết đoạn), thay cho and/but/so/because/although.

---

## Purpose

Task này giúp bạn dùng 4 linking words “formal” rất hay gặp trong viết học thuật/đi làm: `however`, `therefore`, `despite`, `in spite of`. Dùng đúng sẽ làm đoạn văn trông chín hơn và logic rõ hơn.

## Key points

- `however` = **tương phản** (≈ but) nhưng trang trọng hơn; thường đi với dấu câu đúng.
- `therefore` = **kết quả** (≈ so) nhưng trang trọng hơn.
- `despite` / `in spite of` = **mặc dù** (≈ although) nhưng cấu trúc khác: đi với **noun / V-ing**, không đi với mệnh đề đầy đủ.
- `despite` = `in spite of` (nghĩa như nhau; `despite` gọn hơn).
- `however/therefore` là **conjunctive adverbs**: hay đứng đầu câu và cần `,` hoặc `;`.
- Tránh lỗi: ❌ `Despite he is tired...` (sai vì sau `despite` không được là clause).
- Tránh lỗi: ❌ `However/but` dùng cùng lúc; ❌ `Therefore/so` dùng cùng lúc.
- Khi nối 2 câu độc lập: ưu tiên `; however,` / `; therefore,` để đúng văn viết.

## Rule summary

**1) However (contrast)**
- `Sentence A. However, sentence B.`
- `Sentence A; however, sentence B.`

**2) Therefore (result)**
- `Sentence A. Therefore, sentence B.`
- `Sentence A; therefore, sentence B.`

**3) Despite / In spite of (concession)**
- `Despite / In spite of + noun, clause.`
- `Despite / In spite of + V-ing, clause.`

Gợi ý nhanh:
- `Although + clause` (có S+V)
- `Despite/In spite of + noun/V-ing` (không có S+V hoàn chỉnh)

## Examples

**Contrast – `however`**
1) I studied hard. **However,** I didn’t pass the test.
2) The task looks simple; **however,** it is actually difficult.

**Result – `therefore`**
