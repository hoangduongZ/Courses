# A4 – Past Continuous

## Purpose

Past Continuous giúp bạn diễn tả **hành động đang xảy ra tại một thời điểm cụ thể trong quá khứ**. Đây là thì quan trọng để:
1. Kể chuyện với bối cảnh (background) → "It was raining when I arrived."
2. Mô tả hành động bị gián đoạn → "I was watching TV when the phone rang."

## Key points

• **Công thức:** was/were + V-ing (động từ thêm -ing)
• **Time markers:** at 7 PM yesterday, at that moment, while, when...
• **BẪY LỚN:**
  - "while" → Past Continuous (bối cảnh)
  - "when" → Past Simple (hành động chính)
• **Spelling rules -ing:**
  - run → running (nhân đôi phụ âm cuối nếu 1 âm tiết + 1 nguyên âm + 1 phụ âm)
  - make → making (bỏ -e câm)
  - study → studying (giữ -y)
• **Negative:** was/were + NOT + V-ing
• **Question:** Was/Were + subject + V-ing?
