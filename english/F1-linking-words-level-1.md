# F1 – Linking words Level 1 (and / but / so / because / although)

> Mục tiêu task: nối ý rõ ràng khi nói/viết đoạn ngắn (cause–result, contrast), tránh câu rời rạc.

---

## Purpose

Task này giúp bạn **nối 2 ý** thành câu/đoạn mạch lạc bằng các linking words cơ bản (and/but/so/because/although). Dùng đúng sẽ làm câu “logic” hơn và giảm lỗi viết câu cụt.

## Key points

- `and` = thêm thông tin (addition).
- `but` = tương phản (contrast) giữa 2 ý.
- `so` = kết quả/hệ quả (result) từ ý trước.
- `because` = nguyên nhân (cause) cho ý sau.
- `although` = nhượng bộ (concession): “mặc dù … nhưng …”.
- `because` và `so` **không dùng cùng lúc** trong 1 câu kiểu *Because…, so …*.
- `although` **không đi với** `but` trong cùng một cấu trúc (*Although…, but …* là sai).
- Phân biệt **mệnh đề** (clause: có S+V) vs **cụm từ** (phrase: không có S+V). 5 từ nối trong task này nối **mệnh đề**.

## Rule summary

- `and / but / so`: nối 2 mệnh đề độc lập
  - `Clause 1 + and/but/so + Clause 2.`
- `because / although`: có thể đứng đầu hoặc giữa câu
  - `Clause + because + Clause.`
  - `Because + Clause, + Clause.`
  - `Clause + although + Clause.` (ít dùng hơn trong viết cơ bản)
  - `Although + Clause, + Clause.`

Gợi ý dấu câu (basic):
- Khi `Because/Although` đứng đầu câu: thường có dấu phẩy sau mệnh đề đầu: `Because ..., ...` / `Although ..., ...`

## Examples

**Addition – `and`**
1) I study every night, **and** I review new words on weekends.
2) She likes coffee, **and** she drinks it every morning.

**Contrast – `but`**
3) I want to go out, **but** I have a lot of homework.
4) He is smart, **but** he is sometimes lazy.

**Result – `so`**
5) It was raining, **so** we stayed at home.
6) I missed the bus, **so** I was late for class.

**Cause – `because`**
7) I stayed at home **because** I was tired.
8) **Because** I was tired, I stayed at home.

**Concession – `although`**
9) **Although** it was raining, we went for a walk.
10) **Although** she was sick, she went to work.

## Common mistakes

1) ❌ Because I was tired, **so** I stayed at home.
   - ✅ Because I was tired, I stayed at home.

2) ❌ Although it was cold, **but** I went out.
   - ✅ Although it was cold, I went out.

3) ❌ I stayed at home **because** I was tired, **so** I didn’t go out.
   - ✅ I stayed at home because I was tired. I didn’t go out.
   - (hoặc) ✅ I was tired, so I stayed at home and didn’t go out.

4) ❌ I like English **because** it is interesting, **because** I want a better job.
   - ✅ I like English because it is interesting, and I want a better job.

5) ❌ I was late **because** I missed the bus. (đúng) nhưng bạn muốn nhấn “kết quả” lại dùng because sai mục tiêu.
   - ✅ I missed the bus, so I was late.

6) ❌ Dùng linking word nhưng 1 vế không phải mệnh đề:
   - ❌ Because of I was tired, I stayed at home.
   - ✅ Because I was tired, I stayed at home.

## Practice A

**A1 — Choose the best linker (and / but / so / because / although)**

1) I was hungry, ___ I made a sandwich.
2) She studies hard, ___ she doesn’t get good grades.
3) ___ it was late, we kept talking.
4) I stayed at home ___ it was raining.
5) He likes math, ___ he hates physics.
6) I didn’t go to the gym ___ I was sick.
7) I forgot my umbrella, ___ I got wet.
8) They are friendly, ___ they are very quiet.

**A2 — Fix the sentence (error correction)**

9) Because I was tired, so I went to bed early.
10) Although it was expensive, but I bought it.
11) I was late because I missed the bus, so my teacher was angry.

**A3 — Combine (make 1 correct sentence using the given linker)**

12) (and) I finished my work. I watched a movie.
13) (but) She is young. She is very responsible.
14) (so) It was very hot. We opened the window.
15) (although) He didn’t have much money. He helped his friend.

## Answer key

1) **so** — hungry → result: made a sandwich.
2) **but** — contrast between effort and result.
3) **Although** — concession: late but continued.
4) **because** — reason: raining.
5) **but** — contrast.
6) **because** — reason: sick.
7) **so** — result: got wet.
8) **but** — contrast.

9) ✅ Because I was tired, I went to bed early. — không dùng `because` với `so` cùng lúc.
10) ✅ Although it was expensive, I bought it. — không dùng `although` với `but` cùng lúc.
11) Một cách sửa gọn:
- ✅ I was late because I missed the bus. My teacher was angry.
  - Giải thích: câu đang nhồi 2 quan hệ (cause + result) làm rối.

12) ✅ I finished my work, and I watched a movie.
13) ✅ She is young, but she is very responsible.
14) ✅ It was very hot, so we opened the window.
15) ✅ Although he didn’t have much money, he helped his friend.

## Practice B

Viết theo template (mỗi đề 2–3 câu). Dùng **đúng ít nhất 2 linking words**/đề.

1) Routine: thói quen học tiếng Anh của bạn (dùng `and`).
2) Contrast: 1 điều bạn muốn làm nhưng không thể (dùng `but`).
3) Cause–result: 1 tình huống khiến bạn thay đổi kế hoạch (dùng `because` hoặc `so`).
4) Concession: bạn làm gì dù có khó khăn (dùng `although`).
5) Mini paragraph (4–5 câu): chủ đề “study/work” dùng đủ 5 từ nối: `and, but, so, because, although`.

## Self-check rubric

- Tôi phân biệt được `because` (cause) vs `so` (result).
- Tôi không dùng *Because…, so …*.
- Tôi không dùng *Although…, but …*.
- Mỗi vế trước/sau linker đều là **clause (S+V)**.
- Đọc lại thấy ý “mạch lạc”: addition / contrast / cause / result rõ ràng.
