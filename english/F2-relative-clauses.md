# F2 – Relative clauses (who / which / that / whose)

> Mục tiêu task: gộp 2 câu thành 1 câu tự nhiên bằng mệnh đề quan hệ; biết defining vs non-defining.

---

## Purpose

Task này giúp bạn **gộp câu** để viết/nói tự nhiên hơn (đỡ lặp từ), và mô tả người/vật rõ ràng bằng `who/which/that/whose`. Đây là kỹ năng rất hay dùng khi viết email, mô tả sản phẩm, kể chuyện.

## Key points

- Relative clause = mệnh đề bắt đầu bằng **relative pronoun**: `who/which/that/whose`.
- `who` dùng cho **people**; `which` cho **things/animals**; `that` dùng cho **people + things** (thường trong defining).
- `whose` = sở hữu: “của …”, dùng cho people/things.
- **Defining** (mệnh đề quan hệ xác định): thông tin **cần thiết** để biết “đang nói cái nào/ai”. Không dùng dấu phẩy.
- **Non-defining** (không xác định): thông tin **thêm**, bỏ đi câu vẫn rõ. Có dấu phẩy.
- Trong **non-defining**, thường **không dùng `that`**.
- Tránh lỗi: dùng dấu phẩy sai, hoặc chọn sai `who/which`.
- (Nâng nhẹ, đủ dùng): Có thể bỏ relative pronoun khi nó làm **object** trong defining (ví dụ: *The book (that) I bought…*), nhưng task này ưu tiên viết đầy đủ để chắc.

## Rule summary

**Defining (no commas)**
- People: `N + who/that + V ...`
- Things: `N + which/that + V ...`
- Possession: `N + whose + noun + V ...`

**Non-defining (commas)**
- `N, who/which/whose + ... ,` (không dùng `that` trong style chuẩn)

Template gộp câu cơ bản:
- Sentence 1: `I met a man.`
- Sentence 2: `He works at Google.`
- → `I met a man who works at Google.`

## Examples

**People – `who/that` (defining)**
1) The man **who** lives next door is very friendly.
2) I have a friend **that** speaks three languages.

**Things – `which/that` (defining)**
3) The phone **which** I bought yesterday is broken.
4) This is the movie **that** I told you about.

**Possession – `whose` (defining)**
5) I know a girl **whose** brother is a doctor.
6) This is a company **whose** products are sold worldwide.

**Non-defining (commas)**
7) My brother, **who** lives in Da Nang, is visiting me.
8) My laptop, **which** is three years old, is still fast.

## Common mistakes

1) ❌ The man **which** lives next door is friendly.
   - ✅ The man **who** lives next door is friendly.

2) ❌ My laptop **that** is three years old, is still fast. (comma sai + that sai style)
   - ✅ My laptop, **which** is three years old, is still fast.

3) ❌ I met a woman, who works here. (dùng non-defining làm câu “mơ hồ”) 
   - ✅ I met a woman **who** works here. (defining: cần để biết người nào)

4) ❌ I know a man **who** car is very expensive.
   - ✅ I know a man **whose** car is very expensive.

5) ❌ The book, which I bought yesterday is interesting. (thiếu dấu phẩy đóng)
   - ✅ The book, which I bought yesterday, is interesting.

6) ❌ The person who I talked yesterday. (thiếu giới từ/thiếu cấu trúc)
   - ✅ The person who I talked **to** yesterday was helpful.

## Practice B

Viết theo template (mỗi đề 3–5 câu). Mỗi đề dùng **ít nhất 2** relative clauses.

1) Describe a person: một người bạn/đồng nghiệp (dùng `who` + `whose`).
2) Describe a thing: laptop/phone/app bạn hay dùng (dùng `which/that`).
3) Describe a place: quán cà phê/city bạn thích (1 câu defining + 1 câu non-defining).
4) Mini story: 5 câu kể chuyện ngắn, có ít nhất 2 relative clauses.
5) Rewrite: viết lại 6 câu đơn của bạn thành 3 câu có relative clauses.

## Self-check rubric

- Tôi chọn đúng `who` (people) vs `which` (things) vs `whose` (possession).
- Tôi phân biệt defining (no commas) và non-defining (commas).
- Tôi không dùng `that` trong non-defining.
- Tôi đặt dấu phẩy đủ cặp khi dùng non-defining.
- Câu sau khi gộp vẫn đúng nghĩa và không mơ hồ.
