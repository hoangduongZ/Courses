# A3 – Past Simple

## Purpose

Past Simple giúp bạn kể lại **hành động/sự kiện đã xảy ra và kết thúc trong quá khứ**. Đây là thì quan trọng nhất để:
1. Kể chuyện, tự thuật kinh nghiệm (I went to Paris last year)
2. Viết báo cáo, email về việc đã hoàn thành (We finished the project yesterday)

---

## Key points

• **Công thức:** V2/V-ed (động từ ở dạng quá khứ)
• **Time markers QUAN TRỌNG:** yesterday, last (week/month/year), ago, in 2020, when I was young...
• **BẪY LỚN:** có time marker quá khứ rõ ràng → LUÔN dùng Past Simple (không dùng Present Perfect)
• **Irregular verbs (bất quy tắc):** go→went, see→saw, have→had, make→made... (phải học thuộc ~50 động từ)
• **Regular verbs (quy tắc):** thêm -ed: work→worked, play→played, study→studied
• **Spelling rules -ed:**
  - stop → stopped (nhân đôi phụ âm cuối nếu 1 âm tiết + 1 nguyên âm + 1 phụ âm)
  - study → studied (đổi y→i+ed)
  - arrive → arrived (chỉ thêm -d nếu đã có -e)
• **Negative:** did + NOT + V1 (didn't + V1)
• **Question:** Did + subject + V1?

## Rule summary

| Type | Form | Example |
|------|------|---------|

| **Negative** | didn't + V1 | I didn't go / She didn't work |
| **Question** | Did + S + V1? | Did you go? / Did she work? |

**⚠️ LƯU Ý:**

## Common mistakes

| ❌ SAI | ✅ ĐÚNG | Giải thích |
|--------|---------|------------|
| I goed to school yesterday | I went to school yesterday | "go" là bất quy tắc: go→went |
| She didn't went home | She didn't go home | Sau "didn't" dùng V1, không V2 |
| Did you saw him? | Did you see him? | Sau "Did" dùng V1, không V2 |
| I go to Paris last year | I went to Paris last year | "last year" → Past Simple |
| He work yesterday | He worked yesterday | Thiếu -ed |
| They have finished yesterday | They finished yesterday | "yesterday" → Simple, không Perfect |
