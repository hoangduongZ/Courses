# A9 – Mix Tenses (Application)

## Purpose

A9 giúp bạn **dùng thì trong đoạn văn thật** (không chỉ từng câu rời): biết chuyển thì mượt khi kể routine → now, kể chuyện quá khứ (simple + continuous), và dùng perfect đúng khi nói trải nghiệm/kết quả/kéo dài.

---

## Key points

- A9 là “bài ứng dụng”: bạn phải **chọn thì theo ý nghĩa + time markers**, không chọn theo cảm giác.
- 3 đoạn cần viết (mỗi đoạn 5–7 câu):
  1) **routine + now** → Present Simple + Present Continuous
  2) **past story** → Past Simple + Past Continuous
  3) **perfect** → Present Perfect (experience/result/duration)
- **BẪY #1:** viết cả đoạn toàn 1 thì → đoạn thiếu tự nhiên/không đúng timeline.
- **BẪY #2:** dùng Present Perfect với finished time (yesterday/last/in 2020) → sai.
- **BẪY #3:** nhầm “background vs main event” (continuous vs simple) trong past story.

---

## Rule summary

### Paragraph 1: Routine + now
- Routine/habit/fact: **Present Simple** (V1 / V-s)
- Right now/at the moment: **Present Continuous** (am/is/are + V-ing)

### Paragraph 2: Past story
- Main events (chuỗi sự kiện): **Past Simple** (V2/ed)
- Background / action in progress: **Past Continuous** (was/were + V-ing)

### Paragraph 3: Perfect
- Experience: **have/has + V3** (ever/never/before)
- Result now: **have/has + V3** (already/just/yet)
- Duration: **have/has + V3 + since/for**
